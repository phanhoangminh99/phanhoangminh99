### 🚀 Featured Projects

**[Brain Scan Classification (MRI)](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/brain-scan-classification)**  *(Deep Learning / Computer Vision)*

- **Problem:** MRI scans require careful preprocessing and are slow to interpret at scale.
- **What I did:** Built a reproducible CNN training pipeline covering preprocessing, training, validation, and error analysis.
- **Technique:** CNN-based image classification  
- **Result:** Delivered a strong baseline model with clear diagnostics on performance and failure cases.


**[E-Commerce Customer Segmentation & Personalization Strategy](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/ecommerce-customer-segmentation)**  *(Segmentation)*

- **Problem:** Broad campaigns limited personalization and ROI.
- **What I did:** Engineered RFM features, clustered customers, and mapped segments to targeted marketing strategies.
- **Technique:** RFM analysis + K-Means clustering  
- **Result:** Modeled **+20% uplift** for top customers and **3–5% lift** across the broader base (~**37% ROI**).


**[BureauBot — AI-Powered Form Completion Assistant](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/bureaubot-capstone)**  *(AI / LLM Product)*

- **Problem:** Immigration and legal forms are repetitive and error-prone.
- **What I did:** Built an LLM-powered assistant that guides users step-by-step and fills PDFs programmatically.
- **Technique:** LLM orchestration + schema-driven extraction + PDF parsing  
- **Result:** Reduced manual data entry and improved form consistency.


**[Laptop Market Report Dashboard](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/Laptop-Market-Report-Dashboard)**  *(Visualization / BI)*

- **Problem:** Laptop market data is fragmented and changes frequently.
- **What I did:** Built a Python scraping pipeline and delivered an interactive Power BI dashboard.
- **Technique:** Python data collection + Power BI  
- **Result:** Enabled fast comparison of pricing, specs, brand positioning, and trends.


**[Boston Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/boston-housing-price-prediction)**  *(Regression / Fundamental)s*

- **Problem:** Housing prices depend on multiple correlated features.
- **What I did:** Performed EDA, trained regression models, and interpreted coefficients.
- **Technique:** Regression modeling + exploratory analysis  
- **Result:** Built a solid baseline model and identified key price drivers.
