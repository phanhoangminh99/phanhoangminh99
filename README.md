### 📂 Featured Projects

**[BureauBot — AI-Powered Form Completion Assistant](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/bureaubot-capstone)**  *(Agentic AI / LLM Workflow )*

- **Problem:** Immigration and legal forms are repetitive and error-prone.
- **What I did:** Built an LLM-powered assistant that guides users step-by-step and fills PDFs programmatically.
- **Technique:** Agentic LLM workflows + schema-first data extraction + deterministic PDF field mapping
- **Result:** Consolidated end-to-end legal form completion into a single system, eliminating redundant data entry and reducing user error.

**[U-3 Unemployment Rate Forecasting](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/u3-labor-underutilization-rate-forecasting)** *(Applied Econometrics / Time Series)*

- **Problem:** Short-term unemployment forecasting is difficult due to strong temporal dependence, multicollinearity across macro indicators, and limited availability of forward-looking signals.
- **What I did:** Built an interpretable forecasting pipeline using monthly U.S. macroeconomic, housing, and business data to predict the U-3 unemployment rate ahead of release.
- **Technique:** Lag-based time-series modeling + forward feature selection + rigorous residual and diagnostic analysis.
- **Result:** Produced a November 2024 unemployment forecast of 4.14%, closely matching the reported 4.2%, while retaining transparency and forward-looking validity.

**[Brain Scan Classification Using MRI](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/brain-scan-classification)**  *(Deep Learning / Computer Vision)*

- **Problem:** MRI scans are time-consuming to interpret, and reliable tumor detection and classification at scale is challenging.
- **What I did:** Built and evaluated an end-to-end computer vision pipeline for brain tumor classification and localization, including preprocessing, model training, and validation.
- **Technique:** CNN-based models (ResNet-50, EfficientNet) for classification, with YOLO and U-Net for tumor localization and comparison.
- **Used for:** Automated tumor detection, multi-class tumor classification, and coarse localization to support radiologist review.
- **Result:** Achieved strong tumor detection recall and competitive multi-class performance, and surfaced clear tradeoffs between classification and localization approaches.

**[Laptop Market Report Dashboard](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/Laptop-Market-Report-Dashboard)**  *(Visualization / BI)*

- **Problem:** Laptop market data is fragmented and changes frequently.
- **What I did:** Built a Python scraping pipeline and delivered an interactive Power BI dashboard.
- **Technique:** Python data collection + Power BI  
- **Result:** Enabled fast comparison of pricing, specs, brand positioning, and trends.


**[Boston Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/phanhoangminh99/boston-housing-price-prediction)**  *(Regression)*

- **Problem:** Estimating home values with a limited feature set while avoiding overfitting and unstable predictions.
- **What I did:** Analyzed model behavior using learning curves and complexity curves, then selected model depth via cross-validation.
- **Technique:** Decision Tree regression + bias–variance diagnostics + GridSearchCV.
- **Result:** Identified an optimal shallow model (`max_depth = 4`) that generalizes best and produces stable, interpretable predictions.
